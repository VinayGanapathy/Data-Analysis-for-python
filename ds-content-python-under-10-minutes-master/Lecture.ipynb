It gained a lot of traction around 2006, with its popularity being driven its beauty and simplicity to do Web Development (its main Web Development Framework, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), was released in 2006). From there, it took off as one of the most popular scripting languages.\n","\n","Python is multi-paradigm: you can write code using Object Oriented, Functional and/or Imperative programming.
