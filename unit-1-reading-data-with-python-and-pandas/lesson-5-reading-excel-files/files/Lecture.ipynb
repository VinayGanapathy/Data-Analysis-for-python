These parameters are very similar to the parameters we saw on previous lectures where we introduced the `read_csv` method. The most common parameters are as follows:\n","\n","- `filepath`: Path of the file to be read.\n","- `sheet_name`: Strings are used for sheet names. Integers are used in zero-indexed sheet positions. Lists of strings/integers are used to request multiple sheets. Specify None to get all sheets.\n","- `header`: Index of the row containing the names of the columns (None if none).\n","- `index_col`: Index of the column or sequence of indexes that should be used as index of rows of the data.\n","- `names`: Sequence containing the names of the columns (used together with header = None).\n","- `skiprows`: Number of rows or sequence of row indexes to ignore in the load.\n","- `na_values`: Sequence of values that, if found in the file, should be treated as NaN.\n","- `dtype`: Dictionary in which the keys will be column names and the values will be types of NumPy to which their content must be converted.\n","- `parse_dates`: Flag that indicates if Python should try to parse data with a format similar to dates as dates. You can enter a list of column names that must be joined for the parsing as a date.\n","- `date_parser`: Function to use to try to parse dates.\n","- `nrows`: Number of rows to read from the beginning of the file.\n","- `skip_footer`: Number of rows to ignore at the end of the file.\n","- `squeeze`: Flag that indicates that if the data read only contains one column the result is a Series instead of a DataFrame.\n","- `thousands`: Character to use to detect the thousands separator.\n","\n","> Full `read_excel` documentation can be found here: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_excel.html."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"S0dL0dWguz9Y"},"source":["In this case we'll try to read our `products.xlsx` Excel file.\n","\n","This file contains records of products with its price, brand, description and merchant information on different sheets."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"g0Z8wjNiuz9Z"},"source":["![green-divider](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7065401/52071924-c003ad80-2562-11e9-8297-1c6595f8a7ff.png)\n","\n","## Reading our first Excel file\n","\n","Everytime we call `read_excel` method, we'll need to pass an explicit `filepath` parameter indicating the path where our Excel file is.\n","\n","Any valid string path is acceptable.
